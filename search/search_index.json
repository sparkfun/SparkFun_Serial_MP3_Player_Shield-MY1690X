The IC operates over a serial-UART interface at 3.3V TTL using a command set to control audio playback (Play, Pause, Next, etc.), volume and equalizer settings and query statuses (SD card contents, track name/length, etc.).

The MY1690X can function both as a removable USB drive when connected over USB to load, view or edit files on the SD card. The IC operates over a serial-UART interface at 3.3V TTL using a command set to control audio playback (Play, Pause, Next, etc.), volume and equalizer settings and query statuses (SD card contents, track name/length, etc.). It supports audio files with sampling rates between 8 and 48k with bit rates between 8 and 320Kbps.</p>"},{"location":"singlepage/#connectors","title":"Connectors","text":"<p>The Serial MP3 Player Shield has three connectors.

This allows you to directly add and remove audio files to a connected microSD card. This works great for small audio files but in our testing we found the transfer speed is quite slow and can take several minutes to upload larger audio files. We recommend uploading large files using a USB SD card reader or directly connecting your SD card to your computer.</p> <p>When connected over USB-C (and with a microSD card plugged in) the MY1690X will stay in USB drive \"mode\" until a power cycle. The MY1690X does not have a Reset line so either unplug the board or press the RESET button on the shield to cycle power.</p>"},{"location":"singlepage/#qwiic","title":"Qwiic","text":"<p>The Qwiic connector on the shield lets you easily add other Qwiic devices to the board.
