        How to Solder: Through-Hole Soldering</a>
	</p>

Start by soldering your selected headers to the shield so it can mount on to a compatible R4 development board. We opted for male headers here but you can use stackable headers if you'd like to stack another shield on top of this to add more functionality to your audio project:

After soldering, plug the shield into your development board, insert your microSD card and connect the development board to your computer with a USB cable:
