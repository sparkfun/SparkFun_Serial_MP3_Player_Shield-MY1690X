The MY1690X works with standard microSD cards up to 32GB capacity and formatted to either FAT16 or FAT32.

## Format &micro;SD Card

If you're using a brand new SD card, you may not need to format it though it may come with pre-installed files that could cause performance issues. The Quick Format option in Windows is the usually the simplest method to properly format the &micro;SD card. Otherwise there are many free software options for formatting SD cards available online.

## Upload Audio Files

The MY1690X supports both .MP3 and .WAV audio files and acts as a removable USB drive while plugged in over USB-C to directly add audio files to a connected &micro;SD card. In our testing, we found the MY1690X transfer speed is somewhat limited and can take several minutes to upload larger files. If you're moving a large number or large files to use on the Serial MP3 Shield you may want to use a USB SD card reader or plug your SD card into the matching slot on your computer. 

### File & Folder Naming

The MY1690X requires specific naming conventions for files and folders stored on the SD card. Audio files stored in the root directory must begin with a four digit number (000#) starting at 0001 and can have characters following the numbers. Folders should be named with two digits at the start (0#) and then can have descriptive characters following the numbers. Files stored in these folders must be named starting with three digits (00#) and can have characters after the numbers. Refer to section 6.3 in the [datasheet](./assets/component_documentation/MY1690Xâ€‘16S%20MP3%20Decoder%20IC%20User%20Manual.pdf) for more information on naming requirements.
