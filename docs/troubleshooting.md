## Audio Track Naming

One of the most common issues we expect you to run into will revolve around track naming outlined in the MicroSD Card Setup section of this guide and section 6.3 of the [datasheet](./assets/component_documentation/MY1690Xâ€‘16S%20MP3%20Decoder%20IC%20User%20Manual.pdf).Remember that tracks and folders must start at 0001 (Track in root directory), 001 (Track in folder) and 01 (Folder). Any tracks and folders not explicitly following the naming convention will be ignored by the MY1690X.
